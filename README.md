## Why is it worth to analyse the topic?

The topic is worth undertaking for several following economic reasons:

- Job satisfaction has been consistently linked to higher levels of productivity and performance among employees. When employees are satisfied with their jobs, they are more likely to be engaged, motivated, and committed to their work. This, in turn, can lead to increased efficiency, higher quality output, and ultimately, improved economic outcomes for the company.
- High levels of job satisfaction are associated with lower turnover rates or employee attrition. When employees are satisfied with their jobs, they are less likely to leave the company voluntarily, reducing turnover costs for the organization.
- Analyzing the relationship between compensation and job satisfaction can provide insights into the effectiveness of the company's wage policies. Understanding how changes in compensation affect job satisfaction can help companies design more competitive and equitable compensation packages that attract and retain top talent.
- Employees are one of the most valuable assets of any organization. Investing in employee job satisfaction not only improves individual well-being but also enhances the company's human capital.
